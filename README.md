# Sudoku-Mastermind
A Python based sudoku puzzle generator where the user can either choose to solve a randomly generated sudoku board or watch a CPU solve any sudoku board in mere seconds, using a powerful backtracking (recursive) algorithm. 

NOTE: Here, all empty zeroes in the board are represented with the number "0". The reason for this is because usage of different data types can lead to lots of exceptions.

Here are a few pictures showing the gameplay:
